# Welcome

This is my codebase for my game Fish vs Crab, no longer on the playstore sadly. This is what it looked like:

It had hand-drawn pixel art, a live leaderboard implemented in FireBase, an upgrade system, where you could evolve your Fish, different enemies, powerups, ads with Google Ad mobs (Sorry) ....
